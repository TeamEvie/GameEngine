I (tristan), have made the decision to shut down Evie (the discord bot).

> Thanks for an incredible 0.97 of a year (7 October 2021 â€“ 27 September 2022) :heart:
Evie started as a companion bot for TristanSMP <https://tristansmp.com> enhancing Tristan SMP's Discord server with a custom bot that interacts with player data. During this time, I had another Discord bot I was working on; Jamble (Just Another Music Bot'le) and this was when YouTube started attacking Music bots with legal actions. Most bots shut down, but I decided to work on more "public" features for Evie and rebrand Jamble into Evie. Evie's main features became showing TSMP stats, Moderation utilities, general Discord tools and VALORANT stats.

Later down the track, I shut down Tristan SMP due to the low interest in the server causing no donations and I also lost interest in the server since none of my friends played it anymore either; so why pay for it? Now I have no community servers on Discord to moderate and my main feature of Evie is gone.

I had lost all ideas for Evie since I was no longer moderating any servers, and the flow of features for Evie was from my wanting features that Dyno and the other bots in my server couldn't provide. I started focusing on Evie's infrastructure (which was completely over-engineered).

Fast forward a couple of months and I completely took a break from everything Discord related and Evie's "hub" went offline causing nodes to lose connection to Discord and she went down for a month. When I came back to Discord, I discovered her being offline and had no complaints so I just decided to shut her down for good.

*p.s the evie.pw domain will most likely be re-purposed for another one of my projects*

I plan to reimplement the baking system first, and move from there.
